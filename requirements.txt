Continuing from lab #7, add everything to make it a "real" API with MongoDB integration, linting, validation, and unit tests.

Create a database class as a global singleton to maintain a MongoDB connection pool.
Replace the memory mocks in the Model with a reference to the new database class.
Create a JSON schema to describe the input and output of the application.
Use the JSON schema to validate user input. Return an appropriate HTTP status code and the validation failure message when user input is invalid.
Create an OpenAPI spec that documents your API and covers :
All endpoints
Request bodies
Responses
Parameters
Add linting using the airbnb-base configuration
